This project is set up to use yarn

After cloning the project

### `yarn install`

Installs all the packages

### `yarn start`

Starts the application on port 3000 in localhost

### `yarn test`

Runs the tests. It may say that there are no tests and to hit "a" to run all tests. It should attempt to run the ListView test. Currently having an issue getting the data to render correctly for the UI. So the test would fail.
